# JuliaDugina-Python_geometria
Task:
Implement classes:
• Point class: specified via coordinates.
• Line segment class: must be specified through points.
• Triangle class: specified through segments and points.
• Quadrilateral class: specified through segments and points.

Implement for classes:
• For segments: compare them in length and intersection
• For a triangle area, perimeters: finding a median, checking for an acute, obtuse or right angle, checking that a triangle can be obtained from the given segments.
• For a quadrilateral, checking that it can be created from segments, checking for convexity, finding the perimeter and area.
